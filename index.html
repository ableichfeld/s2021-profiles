          <p>Grace Yeung spent her four years at Northeastern finding her voice, and she intends to use it to change the corporate world for the better.</p>
          <p>A first generation college student, Yeung will be graduating with a degree in business administration with a concentration in marketing and will be moving to San Francisco to work in product management at the software company Salesforce.</p>
          <p>“Within the last four years, I think I’m most proud of the fact that I never waited for permission, so to say, to chase after opportunities, whether it was leadership on campus, campus jobs, co-ops or internships and even off-campus opportunities,” she said.  “I never waited for permission, I just chased after it.”<span class="collapsed yeung">...</span></p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">After facing rejection after rejection from marketing co-ops, Yeung broadened her search and landed a product management position at GE Lighting, where she was able to work with people from different parts of the company as she managed new products from their early development to their launch and every step in between. </p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">She found that other product management co-op options were limited, so she leveraged her network on LinkedIn to land a summer internship at Salesforce, which she parlayed into a full-time job.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">Yeung noticed a lack of community and resources for students trying to break into product management, so she started Product Buds, one of the fastest growing virtual product management communities. Product Buds aims to connect students interested in product management with each other and with professionals well-versed in the field. It all began when Yeung made a LinkedIn post offering virtual coffee chats to people looking to break into product management.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">Today, Product Buds has over 5,000 members from 23 countries, less than a year after its founding last May. They host virtual guest speakers, events, mock interviews and even a book club. </p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">Yeung noted that graduating college in 2021 presents unique challenges, especially for Asian Americans like Yeung, with anti-Asian hate crimes up 169% in the first quarter of 2021, according to a report by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">“In the corporate world, there’s the glass ceiling, whether it’s in technology or entrepreneurship or in the media. But also, there’s a bamboo ceiling. Asian women face both,” she said. “And I am so scared that I am going to have to fight so hard to be heard in workplaces to be promoted and to be paid fairly.”</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">Yeung learned to advocate for herself in the workplace during her co-op and internships, and says she now feels more confident speaking up in the workplace.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">“The silver lining in all this is I have a voice,” she said.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">And she is not afraid to use it to help not only herself, but other underrepresented people entering the tech industry and the corporate world in general.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">“I’ve had those experiences, so I can stand up for myself in the future again, but also, I can help other women, other minorities to stand up for themselves,” she said. </p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">Yeung encourages her fellow graduates to dedicate themselves to making lasting change wherever their careers take them.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">“It’s not about me anymore,” she said. “It’s about who I can empower and bring up with me so that they can also find their voice and so that they can also feel heard and seen at work, at school and beyond.”</p>

          <p>At the end of her third year, Gisselle Rodriguez Benitez decided not to run for reelection as president of the First Generation & Low Income Student Union, or FGLISU, which she had founded. After serving as president for one year, she wanted to make sure it could continue without her. Rodriguez Benitez might be graduating this semester, but she hopes that FGLISU will retain its strong impact long after she’s gone.</p>
          <p>Graduating as an economics major with a minor in data science, fourth-year Rodriguez Benitez’s time at Northeastern has been shaped by a passion for public service and a desire to use her own experiences to support other students like her.</p>
          <p>Rodriguez Benitez is a Federal Pell Grant recipient and the first in her family to go to college. During her time at Northeastern, she identified a need for a community that brought people like her, who had similar backgrounds, together.<span class="collapsed benitez">...</span></p>
          <p class="expandedGraf benitez">“I recognized that the experience that I was having, that my peers were having, wasn’t similar to the rest of the Northeastern community,” she said, describing the gap she felt as a first generation and low income student. “My goal with starting the [FGLISU] space was that it would allow us to congregate in a community, to be able to set goals and foster that sense of community within the organization itself.”</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf benitez">FGLISU officially became a student union in fall 2019. As president, she raised awareness about issues facing first-generation and low-income students, organized social events, collaborated with other universities and created spaces for students to vent and find guidance from their peers.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf benitez">Even though she has since stepped down as president, Rodriguez Benitez said the new leadership has expanded its reach, organizing more informational events like helping students register for government services that are available to low-income students. She is heartened by the direction FGLISU is heading in.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf benitez">“I'm most grateful for the legacy [I’m] leaving there, because they're doing a really great job of including new students, so, freshmen, sophomores, into the environment,” she said. “I think that's something that I didn't have and [that] I'm really grateful exists now.”</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf benitez">Rodriguez Benitez is currently the secretary-general for the Northeastern Student of Color Caucus, where she has continued to strive for the equity that she began working toward with FGLISU. As she approaches the end of the semester, she is deciding between working full-time or pursuing graduate programs in education policy. She’s interested in the economics of education and has previously conducted research into charter schools and school finance.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf benitez">As a 2021 graduate, she will be finishing her college career after a year in a pandemic. However, while Rodriguez Benitez has missed seeing her friends, she has appreciated the flexibility that virtual learning has provided, and she knows she’ll be okay — whatever comes next.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf benitez">Thinking back on her time at Northeastern, she is most grateful for the encouraging community around her.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf benitez">“I think that the quality of my time here has really been shaped by the people that I've interacted with,” she said. “I’ve had so many amazing staff, faculty and peers who have really shaped my perspective on what I want to get out of my education and post-grad plans. So, if there's anything that's been crucial and essential to my development as a student, it's been the different people that I've interacted with, who have guided me toward whatever path I'm on.”</p>

          <p>At the end of her third year, Gisselle Rodriguez sdfsdf decided not to run for reelection as president of the First Generation & Low Income Student Union, or FGLISU, which she had founded. After serving as president for one year, she wanted to make sure it could continue without her. Rodriguez sdfsdf might be graduating this semester, but she hopes that FGLISU will retain its strong impact long after she’s gone.</p>
          <p>Graduating as an economics major with a minor in data science, fourth-year Rodriguez sdfsdf’s time at Northeastern has been shaped by a passion for public service and a desire to use her own experiences to support other students like her.</p>
          <p>Rodriguez sdfsdf is a Federal Pell Grant recipient and the first in her family to go to college. During her time at Northeastern, she identified a need for a community that brought people like her, who had similar backgrounds, together.<span class="collapsed craigg">...</span></p>

          <p class="expandedGraf craigg">FGLISU officially became a student union in fall 2019. As president, she raised awareness about issues facing first-generation and low-income students, organized social events, collaborated with other universities and created spaces for students to vent and find guidance from their peers.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf craigg">Even though she has since stepped down as president, Rodriguez sdfsdf said the new leadership has expanded its reach, organizing more informational events like helping students register for government services that are available to low-income students.
