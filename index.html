          <p>Grace Yeung spent her four years at Northeastern finding her voice, and she intends to use it to change the corporate world for the better.</p>
          <p>A first generation college student, Yeung will be graduating with a degree in business administration with a concentration in marketing and will be moving to San Francisco to work in product management at the software company Salesforce.</p>
          <p>“Within the last four years, I think I’m most proud of the fact that I never waited for permission, so to say, to chase after opportunities, whether it was leadership on campus, campus jobs, co-ops or internships and even off-campus opportunities,” she said.  “I never waited for permission, I just chased after it.”<span class="collapsed yeung">...</span></p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">After facing rejection after rejection from marketing co-ops, Yeung broadened her search and landed a product management position at GE Lighting, where she was able to work with people from different parts of the company as she managed new products from their early development to their launch and every step in between. </p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">She found that other product management co-op options were limited, so she leveraged her network on LinkedIn to land a summer internship at Salesforce, which she parlayed into a full-time job.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">Yeung noticed a lack of community and resources for students trying to break into product management, so she started Product Buds, one of the fastest growing virtual product management communities. Product Buds aims to connect students interested in product management with each other and with professionals well-versed in the field. It all began when Yeung made a LinkedIn post offering virtual coffee chats to people looking to break into product management.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">Today, Product Buds has over 5,000 members from 23 countries, less than a year after its founding last May. They host virtual guest speakers, events, mock interviews and even a book club. </p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">Yeung noted that graduating college in 2021 presents unique challenges, especially for Asian Americans like Yeung, with anti-Asian hate crimes up 169% in the first quarter of 2021, according to a report by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">“In the corporate world, there’s the glass ceiling, whether it’s in technology or entrepreneurship or in the media. But also, there’s a bamboo ceiling. Asian women face both,” she said. “And I am so scared that I am going to have to fight so hard to be heard in workplaces to be promoted and to be paid fairly.”</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">Yeung learned to advocate for herself in the workplace during her co-op and internships, and says she now feels more confident speaking up in the workplace.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">“The silver lining in all this is I have a voice,” she said.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">And she is not afraid to use it to help not only herself, but other underrepresented people entering the tech industry and the corporate world in general.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">“I’ve had those experiences, so I can stand up for myself in the future again, but also, I can help other women, other minorities to stand up for themselves,” she said. </p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">Yeung encourages her fellow graduates to dedicate themselves to making lasting change wherever their careers take them.</p>
          <p class="expandedGraf yeung">“It’s not about me anymore,” she said. “It’s about who I can empower and bring up with me so that they can also find their voice and so that they can also feel heard and seen at work, at school and beyond.”</p>
